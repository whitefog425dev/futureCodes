## Hello there! 👋

- 🚀 **Journey to Web3**: I'm on a mission to become a top-notch Fullstack Web3 Engineer. While I've crafted high-quality dapps for [MetaStreet Labs](https://github.com/metastreet-labs) on Ethereum, I'm now diving deeper into the world of smart contract development with Solidity and the fascinating realm of zero-knowledge proofs for zk-Rollups.

- 🎨 **Mastery in Code & Design**: With 8 years of startup experience, I stand as a product-focused fullstack JavaScript engineer. Beyond code, I'm deeply ingrained in user experience. Armed with a Master's in Human-Computer Interaction and Entrepreneurship, I seamlessly bridge the gap between tech and design. My philosophy? "Building the right things and building things right."

- 🌍 **Vision for the Future**: The breakdown of the global financial system in 2008 was not just an economic event, but a stark indication of deeper societal challenges. While many point fingers at quantitative easing or demographic shifts, I believe the root of our global woes lies in systemic corruption and mistrust. That's where Web3 and the decentralized promise of blockchains like Ethereum come into play - as tools to combat these issues by fostering trust and transparency.

- 📱 **Bridging the Gap**: The potential of Web3 isn’t just about decentralization; it’s about making it accessible to everyone. I'm keen on developing intuitive mobile wallets with exceptional UX to drive mass blockchain adoption. Through account abstraction, Passkeys, and the transformative idea of Decentralized Identity, I'm poised to redefine digital finance and identity.
